# Bangers and Mash

## Ingredients 
300-400g (.5-.75 lb) fresh sausages
400-500g (.5 lb) potatoes, I like Yukon Gold
1 bunch green onions
1 big shallot (or two smaller ones)
oil
cornstarch
Marmite
mustard
butter
milk
salt
pepper

## Instructions
Cut the potatoes into small chunks and get them boiling in water. 

Peel and thinly slice the shallots, then get them cooking in a little oil over medium/medium-low heat, stirring constantly until they are brown and soft, about 5 minutes.

Push the shallots all the way to the side of the pan, and push the pan just off the burner so that they are no longer over direct heat. Put the sausages in the pan and roll them around until they are thoroughly browned, at least 5 minutes.
